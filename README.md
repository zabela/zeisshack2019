## Our approach



## What we achieved

- Evaluated a variety of a cloud architectures for the temparature data pipeline and prediction services. A quick overview can be found [here](azure_architectures_solution.pdf).

- Created a user interaction concept where the line manager responsible for the affected machines is notified by an email such as [this](./email/index.html) that a given machine is in need of maintenance and why this is important.
